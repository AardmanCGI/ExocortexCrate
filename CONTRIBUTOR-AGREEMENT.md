Exocortex Crate Contributor Agreement


This Contributor Agreement ("Agreement") is entered between Exocortex Technologies, Inc., a Canadian corporation having its principle place of business at 89 Forestglade Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada ("Exocortex") and you and/or your organization ("you").

These terms apply to your contribution of materials to a product or project ("collectively the "Project") owned or managed by the Company and set out the intellectual property rights you grant to the Company in the contributed materials.

You hereby agree to the following:

1. The term "Contribution" means without limitation any source code, object code, patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation or any other material posted or submitted by you to the Prjoject.

2. With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and registrations, in your contribution: (i) you herebyassign to us joint ownership, and to the extent that such assignment is or becomes invalid, effective or unenforceably, you hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights under those copyrights.  This includes, at our option, the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees, or other licensing agreements; (ii) you agree that each of us can do all things in relation to your contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and if one of us makes a derivative work of your contribution, the one who makes the derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that derivative work; (iii) you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your contribution against us, our licensees or tranferees; (iv) you agree that Exocortex may register a copyright in your contributions and exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and (v) you agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, pay or render an accounting to the other for any use or distribution of your contribution.

3. With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without payment to any third party, you hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to: make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in any product, work or materials arising out of the project to which your contribution was submitted, and at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

4. Except as set out above, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the contributions. The rights you grant to us above are effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to us, even if your submission took place before the date you sign this CLA.

5. You represent, warrant and agree that: each contribution that you submit is and will be an original work of authorship and you can legally grant the rights set out in this CLA. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for the contributions, or that your employer has signed a separate Contributor Agreement with us; to the best of your knowledge, each contribution will not violate any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights; you are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this CLA. For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this CLA; and your contribution submission(s) include complete details of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, patents and trademarks) of which you are aware and which are associated with any part of your contribution.

6. You agree to notify us if you become aware of any circumstance which would make any of the foregoing representations inaccurate in any respect. Exocortex may publicly disclose your participation in the project, including the fact that you have signed this CLA.

7. This agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of Ontario, Canada without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions or to constructive presumptions favoring either party.  The parties consent to venue and the exclusive jurisdiction of the PRovision of Ontario, and the federal Courts fo Canada.

8. In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted, and the Parties agree that the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall continue to be enforced. The Parties agree that this Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Exocortex relating to its subject matter, and it supersedes any prior agreements, representations, or communications, whether written or oral, relating to that subject matter.

9. The parties acknowledge and agree that they are dealing with each other as independent contractors.  Neither the Agreement, nor any terms and conditions contained in the Agreement may be construed as creating or constituting an employee-employer relationship, a partnership, a joint venture, a franchise, or an agency between you and Exocortex.
